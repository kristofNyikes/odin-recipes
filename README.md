# odin-recipes

This website is the first project on The Odin Project where I applied all the knowledge I learned from the curriculum so far.

This includes headings, paragraphs, images, links to other pages and ordered and unordered lists.

Hopefully later on when I learned more I will return to this project and make it look more presentable
